# Example running script
This subdirectory and test example was created the following ways:
```bash
cd NLGWebsite
mkdir testProjectDir
cd testProjectDir

# create symbolic link to the NLGWebsite 
ln -s ../../NLGWebsite/ .

# run the server
python3 test.py
```

And then got to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
